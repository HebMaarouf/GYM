This project aims to develop an integrated application and website for sports clubs, which enables users to obtain comprehensive information about available sports clubs and activities. Through the mobile application, users can view sports clubs, their locations, subscription prices, available trainers and exercises offered. They can also request customized sports programs tailored to their needs.
On the website, club managers can manage content and information. They can add, edit, and delete sports clubs, and manage the list of coaches, employees, and subscription prices. It also allows them to plan types of holidays and manage holiday requests by employees.
Employees can use the system to manage subscriptions and track payments. They can also search for specific players and view their information, identifying players who have visited the club on certain days.
Coaches can write customized training programs for players and monitor their progress. In addition, coaches can share information about healthy meals and additional services after writing them.
In general, this project aims to facilitate the process of managing sports clubs and improve the experience of players and users by providing a comprehensive platform that combines a mobile application and a website to meet the needs of all stakeholders.
